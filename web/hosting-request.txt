Subject: Request to Modify open_basedir PHP Setting

Dear Hosting Provider,

I am running a Yii2 PHP application on my hosting account and have encountered an issue with the open_basedir restriction. Currently, PHP can only access the web directory (/www/wwwroot/stock.linksbridge.top/web/) and /tmp/, but my application needs access to files in the parent directory.

Could you please modify the open_basedir setting to include the entire application directory:

open_basedir = "/www/wwwroot/stock.linksbridge.top/:/tmp/"

This will allow my Yii2 application to function correctly while still maintaining security.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
